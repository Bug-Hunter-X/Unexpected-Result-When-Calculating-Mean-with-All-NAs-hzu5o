# R Bug: Unexpected Mean Calculation with All NA Values

This repository demonstrates a common error in R when calculating the mean of a column containing only NA (Not Available) values.  The `mean()` function's behavior with NAs is not always intuitive, especially when all values are missing. This example highlights the importance of properly handling missing data to avoid unexpected results.

## Bug Description:
The R script attempts to compute the mean of a column in a CSV file. If this column contains exclusively NA values and `na.rm = TRUE` is not specified explicitly or it is not handled properly, the `mean()` function returns `NaN` (Not a Number) instead of a meaningful indication that no values were present.

## Solution:
The solution involves explicitly handling cases where the column entirely consists of NAs. For example, before computing the mean, check if all values are NA.  If so, return a more informative result, such as 0 or NULL.
